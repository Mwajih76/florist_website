    <p> Wajihs is the brainchild of Persian Jacquet. He is an artisan florist, and it is with love and passion that he fulfills your requests, from the simplest and discreet to the most extravagant. Persian Jacquet works with a selection of quality seasonal products and from the closest possible producers. He is well known to not use any plastics and he works with a focus on local producers. To reduce his impact on the environment, he does not use plastic for packaging, since 2010. Wajihs Persian is of the opinion that local producers have better quality seasonal products, with fewer pesticides, less packaging, fewer logistics. This also allows them to renew themselves, develop, and create jobs. With fewer intermediaries, this local producer is paid at the right price. A responsible and united way for his customers.</p>
